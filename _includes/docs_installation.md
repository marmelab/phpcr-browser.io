To install the web application with the default configuration (see below), run the following command into the browser root dir:

```sh
$ make install
```

This will do the [Configuration](#Configuration) part for you. If you prefer do it on your own run:

```sh
$ make install autoconfig=false
```

You can also use [gaudi](http://gaudi.io) to install PHPCR Browser:

```sh
$ make install-gaudi
# or
$ make install-gaudi autoconfig=false
```
